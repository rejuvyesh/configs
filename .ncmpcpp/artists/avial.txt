Avial (അവിയല്‍ ) is a Malayali Rock Band formed in 2003. Its members are professional musicians who have played in various bands in India and have done tours around the world independently.

The name of the band is taken from a South Indian dish Aviyal, which is traditionally a part of the Sadya, and made with a mixture of contrasting vegetables. The band has mixed to perfection folk music from Kerala and alternative rock, making the band name very suitable.

While it’s true that the lyrics of many songs featured in the band’s debut album 'AVIAL' reflects on a deep sense of eternal timeless awareness, there is a good chance that the global listener relates to the album simply because its musically sound. With elements of Indie rock and folk, embedded in each of the eight songs featured in the first album, Avial has managed to mix to perfection and share with its listeners an altogether unique sound, what the band members calls "alternative Malayali rock".
